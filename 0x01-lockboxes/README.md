# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Overview

This project challenges you to determine if all lockboxes can be opened given each box may contain keys to other boxes. The problem is not just about managing data structures but also about employing efficient algorithms for traversal and checking accessibility.

## Must Know

### Concepts Needed:

#### Lists and List Manipulation

- **Understanding**: Work with lists including accessing, iterating, and modifying them dynamically.
- **Resource**: [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

#### Graph Theory Basics

- **Relevance**: Though not explicitly required, graph theory helps as the problem maps well to nodes (boxes) and edges (keys).
- **Resource**: [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/graph-theory)

#### Algorithmic Complexity

- **Importance**: Essential for writing efficient algorithms, understanding both time and space complexity.
- **Resource**: [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/big-o-notation/)

#### Recursion

- **Application**: Utilize recursion for deep traversal of boxes.
- **Resource**: [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

#### Queue and Stack

- **Usage**: Implement BFS (using queues) or DFS (using stacks) for key and box traversal.
- **Resource**: [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-python/)

#### Set Operations

- **Optimization**: Use sets to track visited boxes and available keys efficiently.
- **Resource**: [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

By understanding and leveraging these concepts and resources, you are prepared to tackle this lockboxes challenge effectively using Python.

## Requirements

### General

- **Editors**: Use vi, vim, or emacs as your code editor.
- **Environment**: Code will run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- **File Specifications**: 
  - Ensure each file ends with a newline.
  - Include a shebang line `#!/usr/bin/python3` at the start of each Python script.
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory.
- **Documentation and Style**: 
  - Document your code adequately.
  - Adhere to PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x) for Python.
- **Execution**:
  - Make all files executable. Set permissions using `chmod +x <filename>`.

## Setup

Begin by reviewing the provided concepts and visiting the recommended resources to solidify your understanding of the necessary programming constructs and algorithms. Ensure your development environment meets the specified requirements to facilitate smooth execution of your Python scripts.
