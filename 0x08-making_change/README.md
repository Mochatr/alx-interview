# 0x08. Making Change

## Project Overview

In the "0. Change comes from within" project, we address a fundamental problem in computer science known as the **coin change problem**. This project falls under the domains of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The primary objective is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make up a specific total amount using a given list of coin denominations. This task challenges you to leverage algorithmic concepts to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient.

## Concepts Required

### Greedy Algorithms
- Understand the workings and appropriateness of greedy algorithms for certain problems.
- Identify the limitations where greedy algorithms may not yield the optimal solution.

### Dynamic Programming
- Grasp the basic principles of dynamic programming for solving optimization problems.
- Understand the concepts of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure specifically applied to the coin change problem.

### Algorithmic Complexity
- Analyze both time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Aim for lower complexity to enhance runtime performance.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- Decompose the problem into smaller, manageable units.
- Compare iterative vs recursive approaches in dynamic programming contexts.

### Python Programming
- Effective manipulation of lists and utilization of list comprehensions.
- Develop functions with efficient looping and conditional logic.
