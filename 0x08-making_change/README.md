# 0. Change comes from within

## Project Overview

For the “0. Change comes from within” project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Below are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete this project successfully.

## Concepts Needed

### Greedy Algorithms

- **Understanding Greedy Algorithms**: Learn how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
- **Limitations of Greedy Algorithms**: Recognize scenarios where greedy algorithms might not provide the optimal solution.

### Dynamic Programming

- **Basic Principles**: Understand dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
- **Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure**: Explore these concepts in the context of the coin change problem.

### Algorithmic Complexity

- **Time and Space Complexity**: Analyze the complexity of algorithms.
- **Efficient Solutions**: Strive for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

### Problem-Solving Strategies

- **Breaking Down Problems**: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- **Iterative vs Recursive Approaches**: Compare iterative and recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

### Python Programming

- **List Manipulation**: Use lists and list comprehensions.
- **Efficient Functions**: Implement functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.

By thoroughly understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-prepared to tackle the coin change problem. You will need to decide whether a greedy algorithm suffices for your particular set of coin denominations or if a more comprehensive dynamic programming approach is necessary to ensure correctness and efficiency. This project not only tests algorithmic skills but also reinforces the importance of choosing the right strategy based on problem constraints.
