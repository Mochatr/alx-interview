# Prime Numbers Game Challenge

## Overview

In this project, you will leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

## Concepts Needed

### Prime Numbers
- **Understanding Prime Numbers**: Learn what prime numbers are.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Identify prime numbers within a range using efficient algorithms.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
- **Efficient Prime Finding**: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.

### Game Theory
- **Basic Principles**: Understand the fundamentals of competitive games where players take turns.
- **Optimal Play**: Learn the concept of optimal play and strategies to ensure a win.

### Dynamic Programming/Memoization
- **Optimization Techniques**: Use dynamic programming and memoization to optimize calculations and game strategies.

### Python Programming
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Use loops and conditional statements to implement game logic and algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Utilize arrays and lists to store integers and track removed numbers.
