# Island Perimeter

## Project Overview

The **Island Perimeter** project involves applying knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The objective is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. This task requires navigating and analyzing 2D arrays and applying logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation.

## Key Concepts

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- **Accessing and Iterating**: Learn how to access and iterate over elements in a 2D array.
- **Navigation**: Understand how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

### Conditional Logic
- **Conditions**: Apply conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

### Counting Techniques
- **Counting Edges**: Develop a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Problem Breakdown**: Break down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

### Python Programming
- **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements**: Use conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

## Requirements
### General

- **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter/Compiler**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- **File endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **Shebang**: The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md**: A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- **Style**: Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
- **Imports**: You are not allowed to import any module
- **Documentation**: All modules and functions must be documented
- **Executable**: All your files must be executable

By understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be equipped to approach the problem methodically. You’ll need to iterate over the grid, apply logical operations to identify the perimeter of the island, and account for the specific conditions described in the task. This project not only tests your algorithmic thinking but also reinforces your ability to manipulate data structures and apply logical reasoning to solve problems.
