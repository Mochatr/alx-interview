# Island Perimeter

## Project Overview
The "Island Perimeter" project involves applying knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The task is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, represented by a 2D array of integers. In this project, you’ll learn how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation.

## Concepts and Skills Needed

### 1. 2D Arrays (Matrices):
- **Accessing and Iterating Over 2D Arrays:** Understand how to navigate through a grid by accessing rows and columns using nested loops.
- **Navigating Adjacent Cells:** Learn how to check the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) to determine the edges of the island.

### 2. Conditional Logic:
- **Determining Perimeter Contribution:** Apply conditions to determine if a cell contributes to the island’s perimeter based on its neighboring cells.

### 3. Counting Techniques:
- **Edge Counting Method:** Develop a strategy to count the edges of land cells that contribute to the island’s perimeter.

### 4. Problem-Solving Strategies:
- **Breaking Down the Problem:** Identify land cells and then calculate the contribution of each cell to the perimeter.
- **Methodical Approach:** Work step-by-step to navigate the grid and compute the perimeter efficiently.

### 5. Python Programming:
- **Nested Loops:** Use nested loops to iterate over grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements:** Apply if-else conditions to check the status of adjacent cells and determine perimeter contribution.
