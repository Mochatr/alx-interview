# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Description

This project requires you to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. You will apply your knowledge of bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming to achieve this. Below is an outline of the concepts and resources that will be helpful for this project.

## Concepts Needed

### Bitwise Operations in Python

Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`).

- [Python Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme

Familiarity with UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes, and understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.

- [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)
- [Unicode and character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)


### Data Representation

How to represent and work with data at the byte level, handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

### List Manipulation in Python

Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.

- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

### Boolean Logic

Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable
